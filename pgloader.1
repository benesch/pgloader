.SH "NAME"
\fBpgloader\fR \- PostgreSQL data loader
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBpgloader\fR [\fIoptions\fR] [\fIcommand\-file\fR]\.\.\.
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
pgloader loads data from different sources into PostgreSQL\. It can tranform the data it reads on the fly and send raw SQL before and after the loading\. It uses the \fBCOPY\fR PostgreSQL protocol to stream the data into the server, and manages errors by filling a pair fo \fIreject\.dat\fR and \fIreject\.log\fR files\.
.
.P
pgloader operates from commands which are read from files:

.
.TP
\-l \fIfile\fR, \-\-load \fIfile\fR
Specify a lisp \fIfile\fR to compile and load into the pgloader image before reading the commands, allowing to define extra transformation function\. Those functions should be defined in the \fBpgloader\.transforms\fR package\. This option can appear more than once in the command line\.
.
.SH "BATCHES AND RETRY BEHAVIOUR"
To load data to PostgreSQL, pgloader uses the \fBCOPY\fR streaming protocol\. While this is the faster way to load data, \fBCOPY\fR has an important drawback: as soon as PostgreSQL emits an error with any bit of data sent to it, whatever the problem is, the whole data set is rejected by PostgreSQL\.
.
.P
To work around that, pgloader cuts the data into \fIbatches\fR of 25000 rows each, so that when a problem occurs it\'s only impacting that many rows of data\. Each batch is kept in memory while the \fBCOPY\fR streaming happens, in order to be able to handle errors should some happen\.
.
.P
When PostgreSQL rejects the whole batch, pgloader logs the error message then isolates the bad row(s) from the accepted ones by retrying the batched rows in smaller batches\. To do that, pgloader parses the \fICONTEXT\fR error message from the failed COPY, as the message contains the line number where the error was found in the batch, as in the following example:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

CONTEXT: COPY errors, line 3, column b: "2006\-13\-11"
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Using that information, pgloader will reload all rows in the batch before the erroneous one, log the erroneous one as rejected, then try loading the remaining of the batch in a single attempt, which may or may not contain other erroneous data\.
.
.P
At the end of a load containing rejected rows, you will find two files in the \fIroot\-dir\fR location, under a directory named the same as the target database of your setup\. The filenames are the target table, and their extensions are \fB\.dat\fR for the rejected data and \fB\.log\fR for the file containing the full PostgreSQL client side logs about the rejected data\.
.
.P
The \fB\.dat\fR file is formated in PostgreSQL the text COPY format as documented in http://www\.postgresql\.org/docs/9\.2/static/sql\-copy\.html#AEN66609 \fI\fR\.
.
.SH "A NOTE ABOUT PERFORMANCES"
pgloader has been developped with performances in mind, to be able to cope with ever growing needs in loading large amounts of data into PostgreSQL\.
.
.P
The basic architecture it uses is the old Unix pipe model, where a thread is responsible for loading the data (reading a CSV file, querying MySQL, etc) and fills pre\-processed data into a queue\. Another threads feeds from the queue, apply some more \fItransformations\fR to the input data and stream the end result to PostgreSQL using the COPY protocol\.
.
.P
When given a file that the PostgreSQL \fBCOPY\fR command knows how to parse, and if the file contains no erroneous data, then pgloader will never be as fast as just using the PostgreSQL \fBCOPY\fR command\.
.
.P
Note that while the \fBCOPY\fR command is restricted to read either from its standard input or from a local file on the server\'s file system, the command line tool \fBpsql\fR implements a \fB\ecopy\fR command that knows how to stream a file local to the client over the network and into the PostgreSQL server, using the same protocol as pgloader uses\.
.
.SH "COMMANDS"
pgloader support the following commands:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBLOAD CSV\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBLOAD FIXED\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBLOAD DBF\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBLOAD SQLite\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBLOAD MYSQL\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBLOAD ARCHIVE\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBLOAD DATABASE\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBLOAD MESSAGES\fR
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
The pgloader commands follow the same grammar rules\. Each of them might support only a subset of the general options and provide specific options\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

LOAD <something>
     FROM <source\-url>  [ WITH <source\-options> ]
     INTO <postgresql\-url>

[ WITH <load\-options> ]

[ SET <postgresql\-settings> ]
;
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
The main clauses are the \fBLOAD\fR, \fBFROM\fR, \fBINTO\fR and \fBWITH\fR clauses that each command implements\. Some command then implement the \fBSET\fR command, or some specific clauses such as the \fBCAST\fR clause\.
.
.SS "Connection String"
The \fB<source\-url>\fR parameter is expected to be given as a \fIConnection URI\fR as documented in the PostgreSQL documentation at http://www\.postgresql\.org/docs/9\.3/static/libpq\-connect\.html#LIBPQ\-CONNSTRING\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

postgresql://[user[:password]@][netloc][:port][/dbname][?schema\.table]
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Where:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIuser\fR
.
.IP
Can contain any character, including colon (\fB:\fR) which must then be doubled (\fB::\fR) and at\-sign (\fB@\fR) which must then be doubled (\fB@@\fR)\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIpassword\fR
.
.IP
Can contain any character, including that at sign (\fB@\fR) which must then be doubled (\fB@@\fR)\. To leave the password empty, when the \fIuser\fR name ends with at at sign, you then have to use the syntax user:@\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fInetloc\fR
.
.IP
Can be either a hostname in dotted notation, or an ipv4, or an unix domain socket path\. Empty is the default network location, under a system providing \fIunix domain socket\fR that method is prefered, otherwise the \fInetloc\fR default to \fBlocalhost\fR\.
.
.IP
It\'s possible to force the \fIunix domain socket\fR path by using the syntax \fBunix:/path/to/where/the/socket/file/is\fR, so to force a non default socket path and a non default port, you would have:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

postgresql://unix:/tmp:54321/dbname
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0

.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIdbname\fR
.
.IP
Should be a proper identifier (letter followed by a mix of letters, digits and the punctuation signs comma (\fB,\fR), dash (\fB\-\fR) and underscore (\fB_\fR)\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The only optionnal parameter should be a possibly qualified table name\.
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "Regular Expressions"
Several clauses listed in the following accept \fIregular expressions\fR with the following input rules:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A regular expression begins with a tilde sign (\fB~\fR),
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
is then followed with an opening sign,
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
then any character is allowed and considered part of the regular expression, except for the closing sign,
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
then a closing sign is expected\.
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
The opening and closing sign are allowed by pair, here\'s the complete list of allowed delimiters:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

~//
~[]
~{}
~()
~<>
~""
~\'\'
~||
~##
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Pick the set of delimiters that don\'t collide with the \fIregular expression\fR you\'re trying to input\. If your expression is such that none of the solutions allow you to enter it, the places where such expressions are allowed should allow for a list of expressions\.
.
.SS "Comments"
Any command may contain comments, following those input rules:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
the \fB\-\-\fR delimiter begins a comment that ends with the end of the current line,
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
the delimiters \fB/*\fR and \fB*/\fR respectively start and end a comment, which can be found in the middle of a command or span several lines\.
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Any place where you could enter a \fIwhitespace\fR will accept a comment too\.
.
.SS "LOAD CSV"
This command instructs pgloader to load data from a \fBCSV\fR file\. Here\'s an example:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

LOAD CSV
   FROM \'GeoLiteCity\-Blocks\.csv\' WITH ENCODING iso\-646\-us
        (
           startIpNum, endIpNum, locId
        )
   INTO postgresql://user@localhost:54393/dbname?geolite\.blocks
        (
           iprange ip4r using (ip\-range startIpNum endIpNum),
           locId
        )
   WITH truncate,
        skip header = 2,
        fields optionally enclosed by \'"\',
        fields escaped by backslash\-quote,
        fields terminated by \'\et\'

    SET work_mem to \'32 MB\', maintenance_work_mem to \'64 MB\';
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
The \fBcsv\fR format command accepts the following clauses and options:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIFROM\fR
.
.IP
Filename where to load the data from\. Accepts an \fIENCODING\fR option\. Use the \fB\-\-list\-encodings\fR option to know which encoding names are supported\.
.
.IP
The filename may be enclosed by single quotes, and could be one of the following special values:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIinline\fR
.
.IP
The data is found after the end of the parsed commands\. Any number of empty lines between the end of the commands and the beginning of the data is accepted\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIstdin\fR
.
.IP
Reads the data from the standard input stream\.
.
.IP "" 0
.
.IP
The \fIFROM\fR option also supports an optional comma separated list of \fIfield\fR names describing what is expected in the \fBCSV\fR data file\.
.
.IP
Each field name can be either only one name or a name following with specific reader options for that field\. Supported per\-field reader options are:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIterminated by\fR
.
.IP
See the description of \fIfield terminated by\fR below\.
.
.IP
The processing of this option is not currently implemented\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIdate format\fR
.
.IP
When the field is expected of the date type, then this option allows to specify the date format used in the file\.
.
.IP
The processing of this option is not currently implemented\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fInull if\fR
.
.IP
This option takes an argument which is either the keyword \fIblanks\fR or a double\-quoted string\.
.
.IP
When \fIblanks\fR is used and the field value that is read contains only space characters, then it\'s automatically converted to an SQL \fBNULL\fR value\.
.
.IP
When a double\-quoted string is used and that string is read as the field value, then the field value is automatically converted to an SQL \fBNULL\fR value\.
.
.IP "" 0

.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIINTO\fR
.
.IP
The PostgreSQL connection URI must contains the name of the target table where to load the data into\. That table must have already been created in PostgreSQL, and the name might be schema qualified\.
.
.IP
Then \fIINTO\fR option also supports an optional comma separated list of target columns, which are either the name of an input \fIfield\fR or the whitespace separated list of the target column name, its PostgreSQL data type and a \fIUSING\fR expression\.
.
.IP
The \fIUSING\fR expression can be any valid Common Lisp form and will be read with the current package set to \fBpgloader\.transforms\fR, so that you can use functions defined in that package, such as functions loaded dynamically with the \fB\-\-load\fR command line parameter\.
.
.IP
Each \fIUSING\fR expression is compiled at runtime to native code, and will be called in a context such as:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

(destructuring\-bind (field\-name\-1 field\-name\-2 \.\.\.)

.IP
When reading unquoted values in the \fBCSV\fR file, keep blanks found in between the separator and the value\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIfields optionally enclosed by\fR
.
.IP
Takes a single character as argument, which must be found inside single quotes, and might be given as the printable character itself, the special value \et to denote a tabulation character, or \fB0x\fR then an hexadecimal value read as the ascii code for the character\.
.
.IP
This character is used as the quoting character in the \fBCSV\fR file, and defaults to double\-quote\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIfields not enclosed\fR
.
.IP
By default, pgloader will use the double\-quote character as the enclosing character\. If you have a CSV file where fields are not enclosed and are using double\-quote as an expected ordinary character, then use the option \fIfields not enclosed\fR for the CSV parser to accept those values\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIfields escaped by\fR
.
.IP
Takes either the special value \fIbackslash\-quote\fR or \fIdouble\-quote\fR\. This value is used to recognize escaped field separators when they are to be found within the data fields themselves\. Defaults to \fIdouble\-quote\fR\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIfields terminated by\fR
.
.IP
Takes a single character as argument, which must be found inside single quotes, and might be given as the printable character itself, the special value \et to denote a tabulation character, or \fB0x\fR then an hexadecimal value read as the ascii code for the character\.

.IP
The names and values of the parameters are not validated by pgloader, they are given as\-is to PostgreSQL\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIBEFORE LOAD DO\fR
.
.IP
You can run SQL queries against the database before loading the data from the \fBCSV\fR file\. Most common SQL queries are \fBCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS\fR so that the data can be loaded\.
.
.IP
Each command must be \fIdollar\-quoted\fR: it must begin and end with a double dollar sign, \fB$$\fR\. Dollar\-quoted queries are then comma separated\. No extra punctuation is expected after the last SQL query\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIAFTER LOAD DO\fR

The supported guards are:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIwhen default \'value\'\fR

The spelling \fIkeep not null\fR explicitely prevents that behavior and can be used to overlad the default casting rules\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIdrop typemod\fR, \fIkeep typemod\fR

When the option \fIdrop typemod\fR is listed, pgloader drops any existing \fItypemod\fR definition (e\.g\. \fIprecision\fR and \fIscale\fR) from the datatype definition found in the MySQL columns of the source type when it created the tables in the PostgreSQL database\.
.
.IP
The spelling \fIkeep typemod\fR explicitely prevents that behavior and can be used to overlad the default casting rules\.

.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIcreate no tables\fR
.
.IP
When this option is listed, pgloader skips the creation of table before lading data, target tables must then already exist\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIcreate indexes\fR
.
.IP
When this option is listed, pgloader gets the definitions of all the indexes found in the SQLite database and create the same set of index definitions against the PostgreSQL database\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIcreate no indexes\fR
.
.IP
When this option is listed, pgloader skips the creating indexes\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIreset sequences\fR
.
.IP
When this option is listed, at the end of the data loading and after the indexes have all been created, pgloader resets all the PostgreSQL sequences created to the current maximum value of the column they are attached to\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIreset no sequences\fR
.
.IP
When this option is listed, pgloader skips resetting sequences after the load\.
.
.IP
The options \fIschema only\fR and \fIdata only\fR have no effects on this option\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIschema only\fR
.
.IP
When this option is listed pgloader will refrain from migrating the data over\. Note that the schema in this context includes the indexes when the option \fIcreate indexes\fR has been listed\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIdata only\fR
.
.IP
When this option is listed pgloader only issues the \fBCOPY\fR statements, without doing any other processing\.
.
.IP "" 0

.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fISET\fR
.
.IP
This clause allows to specify session parameters to be set for all the sessions opened by pgloader\. It expects a list of parameter name, the equal sign, then the single\-quoted value as a comma separated list\.
.
.IP
The names and values of the parameters are not validated by pgloader, they are given as\-is to PostgreSQL\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIINCLUDING ONLY TABLE NAMES MATCHING\fR
.
.IP
Introduce a comma separated list of table names or \fIregular expression\fR used to limit the tables to migrate to a sublist\.
.
.IP
Example:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

INCLUDING ONLY TABLE NAMES MATCHING ~/film/, \'actor\'
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0

.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIEXCLUDING TABLE NAMES MATCHING\fR
.
.IP
Introduce a comma separated list of table names or \fIrugular expression\fR used to exclude table names from the migration\. This filter only applies to the result of the \fIINCLUDING\fR filter\.
.
.IP "" 4

.SS "TRANSFORMATION FUNCTIONS"
Some data types are implemented in a different enough way that a transformation function is necessary\. This function must be written in \fBCommon lisp\fR and is searched in the \fBpgloader\.transforms\fR package\.
.
.P
Some default transformation function are provided with pgloader, and you can use the \fB\-\-load\fR command line option to load and compile your own lisp file into pgloader at runtime\. For your functions to be found, remember to begin your lisp file with the following form:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

(in\-package #:pgloader\.transforms)
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
The provided transformation functions are:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIzero\-dates\-to\-null\fR
.
.IP
When the input date is all zeroes, return \fBnil\fR, which gets loaded as a PostgreSQL \fBNULL\fR value\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIdate\-with\-no\-separator\fR
.
.IP
Applies \fIzero\-dates\-to\-null\fR then transform the given date into a format that PostgreSQL will actually process:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

In:  "20041002152952"
Out: "2004\-10\-02 15:29:52"
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0

.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fItinyint\-to\-boolean\fR
.
.IP
As MySQL lacks a proper boolean type, \fItinyint\fR is often used to implement that\. This function transforms \fB0\fR to \fB\'false\'\fR and anything else to \fB\'true\fR\'\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIint\-to\-ip\fR
.
.IP
Convert an integer into a dotted representation of an ip4\.
